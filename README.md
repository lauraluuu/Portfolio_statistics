## Portfolio_statistics
#### The idea of a portfolio is: "procure a small dataset from your everyday life and apply the methods of STAT601 to it".

Taking care of a baby can be one of the most difficult things. First-time parents or even experienced parents can be nervous and sometimes have hard times dealing with baby stuff. For me, I find it helpful to record the feeding, poops, sleeps etc so that I know whether there is anything I need to worry about. To understand my baby’s daily patterns, I decide to do an analysis on it. Hopefully, this portfolio can also be helpful to other parents and people who want to have babies. This project presents a statistical analysis of my baby’s daily life (including feeds, poops and sleeps) from 1st March to 30th April. I recorded 60 days of my baby’s daily life.
